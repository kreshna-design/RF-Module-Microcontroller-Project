# RF-Module-Microcontroller-Project
4-bit parallel data that goes into the encoder to be converted to serial data. This data is then transmitted by the RF transmitter and successfully received by the RF receiver. The decoder then converts the serial data back to 4-bit parallel to be used for turning on the LEDs.
The specific goal for the project was to demonstrate the capability of the MSP430 microprocessor to communicate wirelessly with an RF transmitter chip and an RF receiver chip, a program written in C programming language will be uploaded into the microprocessor to complete this task. Furthermore, a distance sensor is at the transmitter board is used to turn on certain LEDs at the receiver board. The result of this lab will show how the LEDs at the receiver board will be turned on depending on the distance of an object detected in front 
of the distance sensor. By uploading the code and have the microcontroller linked to the distance sensor, the project shows that the data from the transmitter board are indeed transmitted wirelessly for the purpose of this project. The project could be expanded further for other applications such a device that control the direction of motors.
